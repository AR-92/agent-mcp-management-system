# FastMCP Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for FastMCP, the fast, Pythonic way to build Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and clients.

## What is FastMCP?

FastMCP is a Python framework that provides a high-level, Pythonic interface for building, managing, and interacting with Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and clients. MCP enables standardized communication between LLM applications and tools, data, and other resources.

## Quick Start

```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("Demo ðŸš€")

@mcp.tool
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Add two numbers"""
    return a + b

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run()
```

FastMCP provides everything you need for production: advanced MCP patterns, enterprise authentication, deployment tools, testing frameworks, and comprehensive client libraries.
