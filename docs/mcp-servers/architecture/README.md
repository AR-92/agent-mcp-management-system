# MCP Server Architecture

This document describes the architecture of the MCP servers in the Agent MCP Management System.

## Overview

The MCP (Multi-Component Protocol) server architecture is designed to handle multiple concurrent connections, manage protocol communications, and coordinate with agent systems.

## Components

### 1. Connection Manager
- Handles client connections
- Manages connection lifecycle
- Implements connection pooling
- Maintains connection state

### 2. Protocol Handler
- Parses incoming MCP protocol messages
- Validates message format and content
- Routes messages to appropriate handlers
- Formats and sends responses

### 3. Message Router
- Routes requests to appropriate services
- Implements load balancing
- Handles message queuing
- Provides failover capabilities

### 4. Security Layer
- Authentication and authorization
- Message encryption
- Rate limiting
- DDoS protection

## Data Flow

1. Client connects to the MCP server
2. Connection is authenticated and authorized
3. Client sends MCP protocol message
4. Message is parsed and validated
5. Message is routed to appropriate handler
6. Response is generated and sent back
7. Connection is maintained or closed based on protocol requirements

## Performance Considerations

- Asynchronous processing for high throughput
- Connection pooling for resource efficiency
- Message batching for bulk operations
- Caching for frequently accessed data

## Security Features

- TLS encryption for all communications
- API key-based authentication
- Request rate limiting
- Input validation and sanitization

## Scalability

The architecture supports horizontal scaling through:
- Statelessness where possible
- Shared session storage
- Distributed message queues
- Load balancer integration
