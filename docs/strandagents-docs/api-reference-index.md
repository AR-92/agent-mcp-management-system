# API Reference

This section provides detailed API documentation for all components of the Strands Agents SDK. Each section contains comprehensive information about classes, methods, interfaces, and implementation details.

## Agent

Documentation for the Agent class and its methods in the Strands Agents SDK. The Agent class is the fundamental building block of the framework, encapsulating the logic for interacting with models, managing state, and executing tools.

## Event Loop

Documentation for the event loop implementation in Strands Agents SDK. The Event Loop manages the execution flow of agents, handling asynchronous operations, tool execution, and state management in a continuous cycle.

## Experimental

Documentation for experimental features and APIs in the Strands Agents SDK. These APIs are available for testing and feedback but may not be stable and could change in future releases.

## Handlers

Documentation for various handler classes in the Strands Agents SDK. Handlers provide specialized processing capabilities for different types of events, requests, and responses within the agent framework.

## Hooks

Documentation for hook mechanisms and available hook types in the Strands Agents SDK. Hooks provide a mechanism to customize agent behavior by injecting custom logic at various points during agent execution.

## Models

Documentation for model interfaces and implementations in the Strands Agents SDK. The Models API provides interfaces and implementations for integrating with various LLM providers and model types within the Strands framework.

## Multiagent

Documentation for multi-agent orchestration features in the Strands Agents SDK. The Multiagent API provides primitives and patterns for coordinating multiple agents to work together on complex tasks.

## Session

Documentation for session management classes in the Strands Agents SDK. The Session API provides mechanisms to group related interactions and maintain conversation context across multiple exchanges with agents.

## Telemetry

Documentation for telemetry and observability features in the Strands Agents SDK. The Telemetry API provides mechanisms for monitoring agent behavior, performance, and operational metrics in production environments.

## Tools

Documentation for tool interfaces and implementations in the Strands Agents SDK. The Tools API provides mechanisms for agents to interact with external systems, APIs, and perform actions beyond generating text.

## Types

Documentation for type definitions and interfaces in the Strands Agents SDK. The Types API contains type definitions and interfaces that define the contracts and data structures used throughout the Strands framework.
