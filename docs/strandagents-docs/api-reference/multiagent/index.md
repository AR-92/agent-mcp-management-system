# Multiagent API Reference

Documentation for multi-agent orchestration features in the Strands Agents SDK.

## Overview

The Multiagent API provides primitives and patterns for coordinating multiple agents to work together on complex tasks.

## Core Components

### Agent Coordination
- `orchestrate()`: Coordinate multiple agents on a task
- `delegate()`: Delegate work to specialized agents
- `sync_state()`: Synchronize state between agents

### Communication Patterns
- `send_message()`: Send messages between agents
- `broadcast()`: Broadcast messages to multiple agents
- `receive()`: Handle incoming messages from other agents

### Workflow Management
- `create_workflow()`: Create a multi-agent workflow
- `execute_workflow()`: Execute a multi-agent workflow
- `monitor_workflow()`: Monitor workflow execution

## Patterns

The API supports various multi-agent patterns including swarms, graphs, and A2A (Agent-to-Agent) communication.

More details about the Multiagent API including comprehensive method documentation, usage examples, and implementation details would be available in the full documentation.
