# Cyclic Graph

Implementation of cyclic graph patterns in multi-agent systems.

This example demonstrates:
- Handling of cyclical dependencies in agent workflows
- Detection and management of cyclic graphs
- Prevention of infinite loops in agent execution
- Complex workflow patterns with feedback loops

## Implementation Details

The Cyclic Graph example illustrates how to work with complex workflow patterns that include cyclical dependencies. This includes techniques for detecting cycles, managing state in cyclic processes, and ensuring agents can handle feedback loops appropriately.

More details about this example including code snippets and implementation steps would be available in the full documentation.
