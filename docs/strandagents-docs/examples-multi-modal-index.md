# Multi-modal

Examples of multi-modal agent capabilities.

This example demonstrates:
- Processing of different types of input (text, image, audio, etc.)
- Integration of multi-modal models
- Handling of multi-modal responses
- Cross-modal reasoning and understanding

## Implementation Details

The Multi-modal example shows how to build agents that can process and respond to various types of input beyond just text. This includes integration with models that can handle images, audio, video, and other media types in addition to text-based communication.

More details about this example including code snippets and implementation steps would be available in the full documentation.
