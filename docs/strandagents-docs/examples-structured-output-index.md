# Structured Output

Examples demonstrating structured output capabilities in agents.

This example demonstrates:
- Defining and enforcing output schemas
- Validation of structured responses
- Integration with external systems requiring structured data
- Error handling for schema validation

## Implementation Details

The Structured Output example shows how to ensure agents produce consistently formatted responses that conform to specific schemas. This is particularly useful when integrating agents with other systems that require predictable data formats.

More details about this example including code snippets and implementation steps would be available in the full documentation.
