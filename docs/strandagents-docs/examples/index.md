# Examples

This section provides practical implementation examples for various use cases with the Strands Agents SDK. Each example demonstrates specific capabilities and best practices for building multi-agent AI systems.

## CLI Reference Agent Implementation

Complete example of implementing a CLI reference agent using the Strands framework. This example demonstrates how to create a command-line interface for your agent, proper integration with the Strands framework, and best practices for CLI-based agent interactions.

## Weather Forecaster

Example implementation of a weather forecasting agent that retrieves and processes weather data. This example shows how to integrate external API calls into an agent, handle real-time data processing, and manage responses for different weather conditions.

## Memory Agent

Implementation demonstrating advanced memory management capabilities in agents. This example showcases techniques for storing, retrieving, and managing conversation history and contextual information that persists across multiple interactions.

## File Operations

Example showing how to implement file operations as agent tools. This covers reading and writing files using agent tools, file system navigation, safe file handling practices, and integration with the agent's workflow.

## Agents Workflows

Examples of complex agent workflows and orchestrations. This demonstrates multi-step processes orchestrated by agents, workflow definition and management, coordination between different agent capabilities, and error handling in complex workflows.

## Knowledge-Base Workflow

Implementation of agents that interact with knowledge bases and external data sources. This example illustrates how to build agents that can effectively query and retrieve information from knowledge bases or document collections using RAG patterns.

## Structured Output

Examples demonstrating structured output capabilities in agents. This shows how to ensure agents produce consistently formatted responses that conform to specific schemas, which is particularly useful when integrating agents with other systems.

## Multi Agents

Examples of multi-agent systems and interactions. This showcases how to create systems with multiple agents that work together to accomplish complex tasks, including patterns for agent communication and coordination strategies.

## Cyclic Graph

Implementation of cyclic graph patterns in multi-agent systems. This example illustrates how to work with complex workflow patterns that include cyclical dependencies, including techniques for detecting cycles and managing state in cyclic processes.

## Meta Tooling

Examples of meta-tooling capabilities in agents. This shows how agents can possess the capability to create or modify their own tools during execution, enabling highly adaptive agents that can adjust their capabilities based on the task at hand.

## MCP

Examples using Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools. This illustrates how to integrate Model Context Protocol tools with Strands agents, enabling standardized interaction with various services that follow the MCP specification.

## Multi-modal

Examples of multi-modal agent capabilities. This shows how to build agents that can process and respond to various types of input beyond just text, including integration with models that handle images, audio, video, and other media types.
