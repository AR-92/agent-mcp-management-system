# Knowledge-Base Workflow

Implementation of agents that interact with knowledge bases and external data sources.

This example demonstrates:
- Integration with knowledge bases and document stores
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) patterns
- Query processing and result formatting
- Handling of large document collections

## Implementation Details

The Knowledge-Base Workflow example illustrates how to build agents that can effectively query and retrieve information from knowledge bases or document collections. This includes techniques for semantic search, document chunking, and contextual response generation based on retrieved information.

More details about this example including code snippets and implementation steps would be available in the full documentation.
