# Meta Tooling

Examples of meta-tooling capabilities in agents.

This example demonstrates:
- Dynamic creation of tools at runtime
- Self-modifying agent behavior
- Tools that generate other tools
- Adaptive agent functionality

## Implementation Details

The Meta Tooling example shows how agents can possess the capability to create or modify their own tools during execution. This advanced pattern allows for highly adaptive agents that can adjust their capabilities based on the task at hand.

More details about this example including code snippets and implementation steps would be available in the full documentation.
