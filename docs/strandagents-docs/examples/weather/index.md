# Weather Forecaster

Example implementation of a weather forecasting agent that retrieves and processes weather data.

This example demonstrates:
- How to integrate external API calls into an agent
- Processing of real-time data
- Handling of different weather conditions and forecasts
- Error handling for external service failures

## Implementation Details

The Weather Forecaster example shows how to build an agent that can retrieve weather information from external services and provide formatted responses to users. This example highlights best practices for integrating with external APIs and handling the asynchronous nature of web requests within the Strands framework.

More details about this example including code snippets and implementation steps would be available in the full documentation.
