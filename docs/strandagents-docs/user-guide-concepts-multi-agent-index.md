# Multi-agent

## Overview

Multi-agent systems in Strands enable complex workflows by orchestrating multiple specialized agents.

## Agent2Agent (A2A)

Agent-to-Agent communication allows agents to directly interact with and delegate tasks to other agents.

## Agents as Tools

Agents can be used as tools by other agents, enabling composition of specialized capabilities.

## Swarm

Swarm patterns coordinate multiple agents working together towards a common goal.

## Graph

Graph-based agent orchestration enables complex workflows with dependencies and conditional execution paths.

## Workflow

Workflow patterns provide structured approaches to multi-agent execution with defined steps and decision points.
