# Agents

## Overview

Agents in the Strands framework are the fundamental building blocks for creating AI-powered applications. They encapsulate the logic for interacting with models, managing state, and executing tools.

## Agent Loop

The agent loop is the core mechanism that drives agent execution, handling model interactions, tool execution, and state management in a continuous cycle.

## State

State management in Strands agents allows for maintaining context across multiple interactions and preserving important information between agent runs.

## Session Management

Session management provides mechanisms to group related interactions and maintain conversation context across multiple exchanges.

## Prompts

Prompt management in Strands provides flexible mechanisms for crafting and managing prompts to ensure effective communication with models.

## Hooks

Hooks provide a mechanism to customize agent behavior by injecting custom logic at various points during agent execution.

## Structured Output

Structured output capabilities allow agents to reliably extract and format information according to predefined schemas.

## Conversation Management

Conversation management handles the flow and context of multi-turn interactions with users, ensuring coherent and contextually relevant responses.
