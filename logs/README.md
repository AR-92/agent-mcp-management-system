# Logs

This directory contains log files for the Agent MCP Management System.

Logs are organized by:
- Date (e.g., logs/2025/01/)
- Service (e.g., logs/servers/, logs/agents/)
- Log level (e.g., logs/error/, logs/warning/)

## Log Rotation

Log files should be rotated daily to prevent excessive disk usage.
